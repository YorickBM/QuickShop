# QuickShop
This plugin allows for a huge trading community on your server, users can create shops by shift-clicking with an item in their hand on the chest. This will then ask them to enter a price in the chat, once done within 5 seconds time a shop will be created! 

### Trading Platform
Everyone on the server then can find your shop on the trading center that is accessed with /quickshop list or /quickshop find <item>.
The tradding platforms search commando allows partial naming, as such when typing in 'dia', all shops selling or buying items containing 'dia' in their name will be displayed. The shops are ordered by the amount of stock available inside of the shop.
